Dynamical Maps Simulator

Nonlinear Maps Simulator was developed as a classroom material for the author's 
Mathematics I' classes of the Aeronautical Management Bachelor lectured by
the author at Lusophone University:
https://www.ulusofona.pt/en/lisboa/bachelor/aeronautical-management

The software is part of the international R&D project: 
https://sites.google.com/view/chaos-complexity/

The software code was partially developed using ChatGPT in a human-machine
collaboration for software development.

The software is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The class dmap contains the main attributes and methods for a dynamical map
simulation.
